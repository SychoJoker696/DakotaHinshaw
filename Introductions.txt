Hi, my name is Dakota Hinshaw. I am 21 years old, and I am just starting out with coding.
I hope to one day be a video game designer, working at Ubisoft. I love playing video games in my free time, which is what is pushing me to be a video game designer.
My gamer tag is SychoJoker696.
My nicknames are Koda, Percy, and Sycho. Percy because I want to change my name to Perseus. I got the nickname Sycho from my gaming style.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I am pretty much an open book.
